    Considering the rise of embedded systems over the last 10 years, this work aims to develop an embedded system capable of recognizing a gas through its physicochemical properties in an acoustic way, emitting a frequency range within the range of the tube is projected into a microphone, the amplitude of the tube is projected into a microphone. This is sampled by a system that performs a fast Fourier transform signal to recognize the gas through its physicochemical properties. This experiment is commonly called a kundt experiment, where you have a medium inside a tube and this tube is excited with longitudinal waves.
